Description: Facility for interfacing to low level communication drivers
 asynDriver is a general purpose facility for interfacing
 device specific code to low level communication drivers.
 A primary target for asynDriver is for EPICS IOC device support,
 but other than using the EPICS build system and libCom library,
 most of the code was designed so it can be used outside of an EPICS IOC.
 .
 This package contains headers and libraries needed at build time.
